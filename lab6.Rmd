## Example of a rank-based test

We'll make our own samples, using a pseudorandom generator.

```{r}
set.seed(1414) # psuedorandom generator - everyone who uses this code will have the same random sample
gp_1 <- sample.int(20, size = 15, replace = TRUE) # gives a range from 0 to 20, sample size = 15, once the value of an observation is used, that number gets put back in the possible pool of numbers that can be chosen from, so a number can be used multiple times

set.seed(1424)
gp_2 <- sample.int(30, size = 15, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r}
hist(gp_1)

hist(gp_2)
```
